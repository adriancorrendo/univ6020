-   Is there a REPRODUCIBILITY CRISIS in science?

-   A [Nature survey](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a) with \~1,600 researchers found that

    -   ***+70%*** failure rate to reproduce another scientist's experiments

    -   ***+50%*** have failed to reproduce their own experiments

    -   ***Main causes***: selective reporting, weak stats, code/data unavailability, etc.

## GOOD NEWS IS...

## **Why Reproducibility in Agriculture?**

-   Agriculture research relies heavily on environmental data, often variable and complex.

-   **We have complex challenges** 🗒️

    -   Variability due to environmental factors, soil types, and weather patterns.
    -   Complex datasets involving long-term studies, geographical variability.

-   **Opportunities** ✅

    -   Reproducibility helps stakeholders make reliable, data-driven decisions.
    -   Ensures scientific findings are reliable and valid.
    -   Facilitates collaboration, accountability, and efficiency among researchers and practitioners.
