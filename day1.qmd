## Welcome & Context
- **What is Reproducibility?**
  - In data science, reproducibility refers to the ability to replicate results by following the same data and methods.
  - Essential for transparency, accountability, and validation of scientific results.

## Why does it matter?

::: {.column width="55%"}
-   It is the **#1 skill-gap** in the job market: <br/>

    - Academia, 
    - Industry, 
    - Government, NGOs, etc.

- Is there a REPRODUCIBILITY CRISIS in science?
- A [Nature survey](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a) with \~1,600 researchers found that

  -   **_+70%_** failure rate to reproduce another scientist's experiments

  -   **_+50%_** have failed to reproduce their own experiments
  
  -   **_Main causes_**: selective reporting, weak stats, code/data unavailability, etc.

## GOOD NEWS IS...

## Challenges in [Ag-research]{style="color:#023e8a"}

### [EDUCATION]{style="color:#BA0C2F"} ðŸŽ“

-   Limited curriculum in applied data science

### [REPRODUCIBILITY]{style="color:#2a9d8f"}

-   Limited capability to reproduce analyses & results

-   DATA are rarely shared, CODES even less

### [ACCESSIBILITY]{style="color:#023e8a"} 

-   Yet we are not translating enough science into flexible, and transparent decision tools.

"It all starts with *education*"

## Why bother with [reproducible science]{style="color:#BA0C2F"}?

-   Tracks how and why of specific decisions\
-   Quickly modify analysis and figures\
-   + efficiency\
-   + Transparency\
