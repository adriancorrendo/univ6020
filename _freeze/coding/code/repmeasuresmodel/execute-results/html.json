Normally, we assume that the expected value of a random effect is equal to zero, but with a positive variance.\n\n::: callout-note\nThe most used packages and/or functions for `frequentist` LMMs:\n\n-   **nlme**: nlme::lme() provides REML or ML estimation. Allows multiple nested random effects, and provides structures for modeling heteroscedastic and/or correlated errors (spoiler for repeated measures analysis). This is already part of base R.\n-   **lme4**: lmer4::lmer() provides REML or ML estimation. Allows multiple nested or crossed random effects, can compute profile confidence intervals and conduct parametric bootstrapping.\n:::\n\nFor more information about mixed models in R, please, check out the new [CRAN Task View: Mixed, Multilevel, and Hierarchical Models in R](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/MixedModels.html).\n\n# Why TIDY?\n\nWell, from the hand of [Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/), the \"tidy data\" framework changed the way we code and work in R for data science. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure [@wickham2014]:\n\n-   Each variable is a column,\n\n-   Each observation is a row, and\n\n-   Each value have its own cell.\n\n![](images/tidy-1.png) **Tidy-data structure**. Following three rules makes a dataset tidy: variables are in columns, observations are in rows, and values are in cells.

It is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/). It allows to combine R, Python, Julia, and Java (Observable JS) for the design of reports, applications, websites, blogs, scientific publications, and more...\n\n# 00.

Particularly for mixed models, we will also need its `spinoff`: the *broom.mixed* package [@broom.mixed] .\n\n[![](images/logo-01.png){width=\"168\"}](https://broom.tidymodels.org/)\n\nThe broom package offer three key functions to manipulate models' outcomes:\n\n-   `glance()` to report information about the entire model\n\n-   `tidy()` to summarize information about model components, and\n\n-   `augment()` to add information about observations to a dataset\n\n# 01. REPEATED MEASURES\n\nNow, we are going to reproduce the analysis I've done for one of my papers [@correndo2021]. Particularly, we are going to reproduce [**Figure 2**](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-90297-1#Fig2)\n\n![](images/paste-26DDB04C.png)\n\nFor this paper, we have data from 4 different locations. We tested the levels of soil potassium fertility, hereinafter as soil test K (STK), in long-term experiments (2000-2009) where the treatments of interest were: (i) Control (unfertilized), (ii) NPS (fertilized with NPS), and (iii) Pristine conditions (No Ag-history).\n\nAt each plot/sample, the STK was measured at five-consecutive soil depths (0-20, 20-40, 40-60, 60-80, and 80-100 cm). Thus, they we took \"repeated measurements\" over the space.\n\nWe were NOT interested in comparing locations since they had very different previous history, and crop rotation, so confounding effects may have obscured the inference. Therefore, site was not a factor under consideration, and all the analysis were fitted independently by site.\n\n## i.

Candidate Models\n\nI'm sorry for this, but the most important step is ALWAYS to write down the model.\n\n### a. Formulae\n\n#### m0. Block Fixed\n\nIn a traditional approach blocks are defined as fixed, affecting the mean of the expected value. Yet there is no consensus about treating blocks as fixed or as random. For more information, read @Dixon_2016.\n\n::: callout-tip\nIn my opinion, we should treat blocks as random because the number of blocks we choose is a random sample of all the potential blocks we could have used. However, for a decent estimation of a random effect, the usual amount of blocks we use in agriculture research (3-5) is not sufficient.\n:::\n\nLet's define the model. For simplification (and avoid writing interaction terms), here we are going to consider that $\\tau_i$ is the \"treatment\".\n\n$$ y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\beta_j + \\epsilon_{ij} $$\n\n$$ \\epsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{e} )$$ where $\\mu$ represents the overall mean (if intercept is used), $\\tau_i$ is the effect of treatment-j over $\\mu$, $\\beta_j$ is the effect of block-j over $\\mu$, and $\\epsilon_{ij}$ is the random effect of each experimental unit.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# SIMPLEST MODEL\nfit_block_fixed <- function(x){\n  lm(# Response variable\n     STK ~ \n       # Fixed\n       TREAT + DEPTH + TREAT:DEPTH + BLOCK,\n     # Data\n     data = x)\n  }\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### m1. Block Random\n\nAn alternative approach is considering a MIXED MODEL, where blocks are considered \"random\". Basically, we add a term to the model that it is expected to show a \"null\" overall effect over the mean of the variable of interest but introduces \"noise\". By convention, a random effect is expected to have an expected value equal to zero but a positive variance as follows: $$ y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\beta_j + \\epsilon_{ij} $$ $$ \\beta_j \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{b} )$$ $$ \\epsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{e} )$$ Similar than before, $\\mu$ represents the overall mean (if intercept is used), $\\tau_i$ is the effect of treatment-j over $\\mu$, $\\beta_j$ is the \"random\" effect of block-j over $\\mu$, and $\\epsilon_{ij}$ is the random effect of each experimental unit.\n\nSo what's the difference? Simply specifying this component: $$ \\beta_j \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_b) $$, which serves to model the variance.\n\nHow do we write that?\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# RANDOM BLOCK\nfit_block_random <- function(x){\n  nlme::lme(\n    # Fixed\n    STK ~ TREAT + DEPTH + TREAT:DEPTH,\n    # Random\n    random = ~1|BLOCK,\n    # Data\n    data = x)\n  }\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### Models w/ correlated ERRORS\n\nUntil here all sounds easy. However, we are (potentially) missing a key component. All measures involving DEPTH have been taken from the same \"subjects\" (experimental units/plots). So we do have \"repeated measures\" over space. Thus, it is highly likely that using depth implies the need to adjust the error correlation and covariance structure. Let's explore some options...\n\n#### m2. m1 + CompSymm\n\nCompound symmetry is the simplest covariance structure, where we include a within-subject correlated errors. It is basically the same we do with including BLOCKS as random. We are telling the model that the observations within a given \"depth\" \"share\" something, they have something in common (the error).\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# RANDOM BLOCK w/compound symmetry error correlation structure\nfit_corsymm <- function(x){\n  lme(# Response Variable\n      STK ~\n        # Fixed\n        TREAT + DEPTH + TREAT:DEPTH,\n        # Random\n        random = ~1|BLOCK,\n        # Identify subject where repeated measure happens\n        # Plots nested within blocks.\n        correlation = corCompSymm(form = ~ DEPTH |BLOCK/PLOT), \n     # Data   \n     data=x) }\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### m3. m1 + CorAR1\n\nThe autoregressive of first order structure (CorAR1) considers correlations dependent of the \"distance\". Thus, correlation of error is expected to be the highest between adjacent depths (e.g. 0-20 and 20-40 cm), and a systematically decrease with the distance. For example, the correlation between depth 1 and depth 2 would be $\\rho^{depth_2-depth_1}$, and then less and less, ending with the correlation between depth 5 and depth 1 equal to $\\rho^{depth_5-depth_1}$.\n\n::: callout-caution\nAn important detail here is that CorAR1 structure is only applicable for evenly spaced intervals!\n:::\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# RANDOM BLOCK w/ auto-regressive of 1st order as error correlation structure\nfit_ar1 <- function(x){lme(STK ~ TREAT + DEPTH + TREAT:DEPTH,\n                       random = ~1|BLOCK,\n                       correlation=corAR1(form=~depth|BLOCK/PLOT),\n                       data=x)}\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n#### m4. m2 + HetVar\n\nDid you know that we can \"relax\" the assumption about homogeneity of variance? Oftentimes we have data that shows different variability depending on the level of a given factor or variable.\n\nIn the STK dataset, we observed that the \"Pristine\" treatment (or agriculture condition) present a higher variability compared to Control and NPS treatments, probably linked to higher values of STK. Variance is modeled by adding a \"weight\". This \"weight\" could be a function of a continuous variable (e.g. fertilizer rate?) or, like in our case, based on a \"categorical\" variable.\n\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# RANDOM BLOCK w/compound symmetry error correlation structure + Heterogeneous Variance\nfit_corsymm_hetvar <- function(x){\n  lme(# Response variable\n      STK ~ \n        # Fixed\n        TREAT + DEPTH + TREAT:DEPTH,\n        # Random  \n        random = ~1|BLOCK,\n        # Correlation\n        correlation = corCompSymm(form = ~ depth |BLOCK/PLOT),\n        # Variance\n        weights = varComb(varIdent(form= ~1|GROUP)),\n      # Data\n      data=x) }\n```\n:::\n\n\n\n\n### b.

Soil profiles of STK ($g~m^{-2}$) under three different conditions: pristine soils (green circles), under grain cropping from 2000 to 2009 with no fertilizers added (Control, orange triangles), and under grain cropping from 2000 to 2009 with N, P, plus S fertilization (NPS, purple diamonds). Overlapping error bars indicate absence of significant differences between scenarios by soil depths combinations (Tukey's HSD, p \\< 0.05).\n:::\n\n☺\n\n# 03. ADDING REFERENCES\n\n## i. Citations\n\nAdding references with Quarto has become quite easy. Let's see...\n\nThis is a citation of the Tidyverse [@tidyverse] package.\n\n-   Using a **\"\\*.bib\" file**: Figures were produced using the ggplot2 package [@ggplot_book]. Models check were tested with the performance package [@performance_paper].\n\n-   Using **Footnotes**: For example, this is some text with a Footnote[^1], this is a second Footnote[^2]\n\n-   Using **visual editor**: this option introduced by Quarto is simply awesome! 🤩. Let's see. **Insert -\\> Citation** or \"**Crtl + Shift + F8**\". With this option we can look for citations online via DOI, Crossref, etc... and insert them into our document (and to our \\*.bib file).\n\n    ![](images/paste-62A845D2.png)\n\n    ![](images/paste-54EE18F8.png)\n\n[^1]: Citation for Footnote 1\n\n[^2]: Citation for Footnote 2\n\n# BIBLIOGRAPHY\n",
