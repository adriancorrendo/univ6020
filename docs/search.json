    "text": "iii. Candidate Models\nI’m sorry for this, but the most important step is ALWAYS to write down the model.\na. Formulae\nm0. Block Fixed\nIn a traditional approach blocks are defined as fixed, affecting the mean of the expected value. Yet there is no consensus about treating blocks as fixed or as random. For more information, read Dixon (2016).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn my opinion, we should treat blocks as random because the number of blocks we choose is a random sample of all the potential blocks we could have used. However, for a decent estimation of a random effect, the usual amount of blocks we use in agriculture research (3-5) is not sufficient.\n\n\nLet’s define the model. For simplification (and avoid writing interaction terms), here we are going to consider that \\(\\tau_i\\) is the “treatment”.\n\\[ y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\beta_j + \\epsilon_{ij} \\]\n\\[ \\epsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{e} )\\] where \\(\\mu\\) represents the overall mean (if intercept is used), \\(\\tau_i\\) is the effect of treatment-j over \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\beta_j\\) is the effect of block-j over \\(\\mu\\), and \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is the random effect of each experimental unit.\n\nShow code# SIMPLEST MODEL\nfit_block_fixed &lt;- function(x){\n  lm(# Response variable\n     STK ~ \n       # Fixed\n       TREAT + DEPTH + TREAT:DEPTH + BLOCK,\n     # Data\n     data = x)\n  }\n\n\nm1. Block Random\nAn alternative approach is considering a MIXED MODEL, where blocks are considered “random”. Basically, we add a term to the model that it is expected to show a “null” overall effect over the mean of the variable of interest but introduces “noise”. By convention, a random effect is expected to have an expected value equal to zero but a positive variance as follows: \\[ y_{ij} = \\mu + \\tau_i + \\beta_j + \\epsilon_{ij} \\] \\[ \\beta_j \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{b} )\\] \\[ \\epsilon_{ij} \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_{e} )\\] Similar than before, \\(\\mu\\) represents the overall mean (if intercept is used), \\(\\tau_i\\) is the effect of treatment-j over \\(\\mu\\), \\(\\beta_j\\) is the “random” effect of block-j over \\(\\mu\\), and \\(\\epsilon_{ij}\\) is the random effect of each experimental unit.\nSo what’s the difference? Simply specifying this component: \\[ \\beta_j \\sim N(0, \\sigma^2_b) \\], which serves to model the variance.\nHow do we write that?\n\nShow code# RANDOM BLOCK\nfit_block_random &lt;- function(x){\n  nlme::lme(\n    # Fixed\n    STK ~ TREAT + DEPTH + TREAT:DEPTH,\n    # Random\n    random = ~1|BLOCK,\n    # Data\n    data = x)\n  }\n\n\nModels w/ correlated ERRORS\nUntil here all sounds easy. However, we are (potentially) missing a key component. All measures involving DEPTH have been taken from the same “subjects” (experimental units/plots). So we do have “repeated measures” over space. Thus, it is highly likely that using depth implies the need to adjust the error correlation and covariance structure. Let’s explore some options…\nm2. m1 + CompSymm\nCompound symmetry is the simplest covariance structure, where we include a within-subject correlated errors. It is basically the same we do with including BLOCKS as random. We are telling the model that the observations within a given “depth” “share” something, they have something in common (the error).\n\nShow code# RANDOM BLOCK w/compound symmetry error correlation structure\nfit_corsymm &lt;- function(x){\n  lme(# Response Variable\n      STK ~\n        # Fixed\n        TREAT + DEPTH + TREAT:DEPTH,\n        # Random\n        random = ~1|BLOCK,\n        # Identify subject where repeated measure happens\n        # Plots nested within blocks.\n        correlation = corCompSymm(form = ~ DEPTH |BLOCK/PLOT), \n     # Data   \n     data=x) }\n\n\nm3. m1 + CorAR1\nThe autoregressive of first order structure (CorAR1) considers correlations dependent of the “distance”. Thus, correlation of error is expected to be the highest between adjacent depths (e.g. 0-20 and 20-40 cm), and a systematically decrease with the distance. For example, the correlation between depth 1 and depth 2 would be \\(\\rho^{depth_2-depth_1}\\), and then less and less, ending with the correlation between depth 5 and depth 1 equal to \\(\\rho^{depth_5-depth_1}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaution\n\n\n\nAn important detail here is that CorAR1 structure is only applicable for evenly spaced intervals!\n\n\n\nShow code# RANDOM BLOCK w/ auto-regressive of 1st order as error correlation structure\nfit_ar1 &lt;- function(x){lme(STK ~ TREAT + DEPTH + TREAT:DEPTH,\n                       random = ~1|BLOCK,\n                       correlation=corAR1(form=~depth|BLOCK/PLOT),\n                       data=x)}\n\n\nm4. m2 + HetVar\nDid you know that we can “relax” the assumption about homogeneity of variance? Oftentimes we have data that shows different variability depending on the level of a given factor or variable.\nIn the STK dataset, we observed that the “Pristine” treatment (or agriculture condition) present a higher variability compared to Control and NPS treatments, probably linked to higher values of STK. Variance is modeled by adding a “weight”. This “weight” could be a function of a continuous variable (e.g. fertilizer rate?) or, like in our case, based on a “categorical” variable.\n\nShow code# RANDOM BLOCK w/compound symmetry error correlation structure + Heterogeneous Variance\nfit_corsymm_hetvar &lt;- function(x){\n  lme(# Response variable\n      STK ~ \n        # Fixed\n        TREAT + DEPTH + TREAT:DEPTH,\n        # Random  \n        random = ~1|BLOCK,\n        # Correlation\n        correlation = corCompSymm(form = ~ depth |BLOCK/PLOT),\n        # Variance\n        weights = varComb(varIdent(form= ~1|GROUP)),\n      # Data\n      data=x) }\n\n\nb.
